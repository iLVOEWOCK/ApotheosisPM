# Apotheosis PocketMine-MP Plugin <img src="icon.png" alt="Apotheosis Logo" width="45"/>

Apotheosis is an unofficial replica of the popular Java mod, designed to bring exciting content and enhanced gameplay mechanics to PocketMine-MP servers. This plugin aims to empower players to become stronger while maintaining a connection to the core mechanics of the vanilla game.

## Features

Apotheosis enriches your PocketMine-MP experience with a variety of features that enhance gameplay and offer new challenges. Some of the key features include:

- **Enhanced Progression**: With carefully curated changes, Apotheosis allows players to progress beyond traditional limits, reaching new heights of strength and capability.
- **Cohesive Mechanics**: Every feature within the plugin is meticulously designed to ensure a seamless integration into the vanilla gameplay mechanics.
- **Module System**: Apotheosis is organized into distinct modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of the game. These modules are designed to work independently and can be disabled if desired. Despite their independence, modules often interact with each other to create a holistic experience.
- **Default Enabled**: All modules come enabled by default, ensuring that your server is enriched with new content and mechanics as soon as the plugin is installed.

## Modules

Apotheosis is divided into several modules, each catering to a particular aspect of gameplay. Here are some of the core modules:

- **[Enchantment]**: Experience massive overhauls of the enchanting system, giving players more options and strategies for enhancing their gear.
- **[Adventure]**: The adventure module is the source of all things worth adventuring for. You'll find deadly monsters, naturally generated traps, and more!
- **[Garden]**: The Garden Module makes vertically-growing plants grow even taller. That means that Sugarcane, Cacti, and Bamboo can all grow to increased heights.  So if you're wondering why your sugarcane is suddenly growing to the sky, you can blame me (or the original [author](https://legacy.curseforge.com/members/Shadows_of_Fire/projects)).  These limits are configurable, so you can tone down just how high they go
- **[Spawner]**: The Spawner Module makes some quality of life changes to Mob Spawners. They can now be picked up with Silk Touch, and can be Modified using various items.
- **[Potions]**: The potion module includes new potions, adds new recipes for previously unobtainable potions, and adds some other new content to support the usage of potions.
- **[Village]**: The Village Module is focused around introducing new content for villages, villagers, and their related blocks.  Currently, this is one of the smaller modules
